Just some practices. I didn't join code jam 2019.

### Qualification round

Q1-3 got accepted. Q5 just passed test set 1 by backtracking.


### Round 1A

Sadly only Q3 test set 1 got accepted. Giving test set 2 was planned to give up, but it seems actually not that difficult..
Time's up when doing Q2 without any submission.
